âœ… 1. Structured Bindings
=======================================================================================
Q1. What are structured bindings?
Q2. How would you extract values from a std::map<K, V> entry using structured bindings?
Q3. Can structured bindings be used with user-defined structs? Provide an example.

ðŸ§  Challenge:
Given a function returning std::tuple<int, std::string, float>, use structured binding to destructure and process the data.

âœ… 2. if constexpr
Q1. What is the difference between if constexpr and if?
Q2. How does if constexpr affect template instantiation?

ðŸ§  Challenge:
Implement a templated function that:

Adds two numbers if they are integral

Concatenates if they are strings
Use if constexpr.

âœ… 3. std::optional
Q1. How does std::optional improve code safety compared to returning null pointers or sentinel values?
Q2. What are the ways to check if an optional holds a value?

ðŸ§  Challenge:
Implement std::optional<std::string> getUsernameById(int id); that returns empty if user not found.

âœ… 4. std::variant
Q1. What is std::variant and how is it different from union?
Q2. What happens if you access the wrong type from a variant?

ðŸ§  Challenge:
Write a std::variant<int, float, std::string> and a visitor that prints type and value using std::visit.

âœ… 5. std::string_view
Q1. What are the benefits and risks of std::string_view?
Q2. When would you avoid using string_view?

ðŸ§  Challenge:
Implement a function that splits a string using std::string_view without creating any new strings.

âœ… 6. Inline Variables
Q1. What problem does inline solve for global constexpr variables in headers?
Q2. How does it affect ODR (One Definition Rule)?

ðŸ§  Challenge:
Write a Config class with an inline static variable shared across multiple files.

âœ… 7. Fold Expressions
Q1. What are fold expressions and how do they simplify variadic templates?
Q2. Can you use fold expressions with custom operators?

ðŸ§  Challenge:
Write a function allOf(...) using fold expression that returns true if all arguments are true.

âœ… 8. Filesystem Library
Q1. How do you check if a file exists using C++17 filesystem?
Q2. How do you get a list of all .txt files in a directory?

ðŸ§  Challenge:
Create a folder logs if it doesn't exist. Then scan and delete all .tmp files.

âœ… 9. [[nodiscard]] Attribute
Q1. How does [[nodiscard]] prevent bugs?
Q2. Can you apply [[nodiscard]] to structs or types?

ðŸ§  Challenge:
Create a Status struct marked [[nodiscard]]. Return it from functions and verify compiler warning when unused.

âœ… 10. __has_include
Q1. Whatâ€™s the purpose of __has_include?
Q2. How do you use it to make your library portable across compilers?

ðŸ§  Challenge:
Use __has_include(<filesystem>) to fallback to Boost filesystem if standard is unavailable.
