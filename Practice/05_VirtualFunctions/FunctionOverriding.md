Function overriding in C++ is needed for runtime polymorphism, which allows a derived class to provide a specific
implementation of a function that is already defined in its base class. This is crucial for achieving dynamic dispatch in object-oriented programming.

Why is Function Overriding Needed?
-> 1.Enables Runtime Polymorphism
    Overriding allows a base class pointer/reference to call the correct function implementation in a derived class at runtime.
    This is achieved through virtual functions and dynamic binding.

-> 2.Provides Specific Implementations in Derived Classes
    The base class provides a general interface, while derived classes can provide specific behavior by overriding functions.

-> 3.Ensures Correct Behavior in Inheritance
    Prevents unintended function hiding. If a base class function is not marked as virtual, the derived class function will not override it but will instead hide it.

-> 4.Achieves Interface-Based Programming
    If a base class acts as an interface, all derived classes can override the same function to provide their unique behavior.

-> 5.Supports Extensibility and Maintainability
    New derived classes can modify behavior without changing the base class.
