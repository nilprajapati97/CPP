-: ðŸ”¹ Behavioral Patterns ðŸ”¹
Improve or enable interaction and communication between objects.

âœ… Observer â€” Publish/Subscribe notifications to multiple dependents.
âœ… Strategy â€” Select algorithmâ€™s behavior at runtime.
âœ… Command â€” Encapsulate requests as object (for queuing, logging, undo/redo).
âœ… Chain of Responsibility â€” Pass requests along a chain of handlers.
âœ… Mediator â€” Centralize complex communications between components.
âœ… Iterator â€” Traverse elements in a collection gracefully.
âœ… Memento â€” Save and restore objectâ€™s state.
âœ… State â€” Alter behavior when objectâ€™s internal state evolves.
âœ… Template Method â€” General algorithm structure with customizable steps.
âœ… Visitor â€” Add operations to object structures without changing their classes.
