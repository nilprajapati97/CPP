/*
ðŸ”¹ What is Factory Method? ðŸ”¹
===========================================
Factory Method lets you create object instances without specifying their exact class.
Instead of instantiating directly with new ConcreteClass(), you call a factory method â€”
this lets subclasses decide which class to create.

    ðŸ”¹ Summary ðŸ”¹
âœ… Factory Method lets you create objects without specifying their exact class.
âœ… Provides a way to enable subclasses to determine which object to create.
âœ… Helps promote code reuse and follow the Open/Close Principle (open for extension, closed for modification).
