/*
ðŸ”¹ What is Builder Design Pattern? ðŸ”¹
===================================================================
Builder lets you construct complex objects step by step.
It separates the algorithm for object creation from its representation.
This allows you to reuse the algorithm to create different representations of the object.

ðŸ”¹ C++ Example ðŸ”¹
==========================
Let's say we want to construct a Car with various components (engine, seats, GPS...).
Instead of putting all this into a huge constructor, we use Builder.

// Product - Car
// This is the complex object we want to construct.

        this->engine = engine;

    void setGPS(bool gps) {
        this->gps = gps;
    }

        cout << "Car details:" << endl;
        cout << "Engine: " << engine << endl;
        cout << "Seats: " << seats << endl;
        cout << "GPS: " << (gps ? "Yes" : "No") << endl;

/*
output
===================================
Car details:
Engine: V8 Sport Engine
Seats: 2
GPS: Yes

Car details:
Engine: V4 Family Engine
Seats: 5
GPS: No



ðŸ”¹ Summary ðŸ”¹
==========================================================
âœ… Builder lets you construct complex objects step by step.
âœ… Separates algorithm from representation â€” it's easy to create different variants of an object.
âœ… Helps make code more flexible and easier to maintain or extend.
