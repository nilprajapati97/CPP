-: ðŸ”¹ Structural Patterns ðŸ”¹
Organize classes or objects to form larger structures while retaining flexibility.

âœ… Adapter â€” Convert one interface to another (for compatibility).
âœ… Composite â€” Create tree structures to enable uniform treatment of composite and leaf components.
âœ… Proxy â€” Provides a placeholder or surrogate for another object.
âœ… Decorator â€” Add responsibilities to an object dynamically.
âœ… Bridge â€” Separate abstraction from implementation.
âœ… Facet/Facade â€” Provides a simplified interface to a complex subsystem.
âœ… Flyweight â€” Share fine-grained object state efficiently.
